                            PWGen for Windows
                            =================
                Copyright (c) 2002-2016 by Christian Thöing


Version 2.9.0 (2016-09-09)

NEW FEATURES:

- New option "Specify length" for the "Include words" setting, which allows
  selecting passphrases with a certain length or length range; if enabled,
  only passphrases with lengths in the specified range will be displayed or
  added to the password list
- Check on start-up if an instance of PWGen is already running; if so, the user
  is asked to close the instance before starting a new one
- New option "Change font" in the context menu of the "Quick help" window

CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS:

- Changed hot keys for profiles (via main menu: File > Profile) from
  <Ctrl>+<Alt>+... to <Alt>+<Shift>+... in order to avoid ambiguities with the
  <AltGr> key in Windows, which is frequently used to access special characters
  on non-English keyboard layouts (<Ctrl>+<Alt> = <AltGr>)

FIXES:

- Password option "Include at least one lower-case letter" did not work for
  phonetic passwords with mixed-case letters ("<phoneticx>" character set)
  (setting was ignored)

----------

Version 2.8.0 (2016-04-19)

NEW FEATURES:

- drag & drop support for the password boxes in the main window and in the "MP
  Password Generator" dialog, as well as for password lists: a drag & drop
  operation can be started by left-clicking on the password security bar below
  the password box and holding the mouse button; in the password list window,
  text can be directly dragged from the password list itself; the password(s)
  (or a selection thereof) may be dropped to any application registered as a
  drop target; conversely, the password boxes can act as drop targets and
  receive text from other applications
- new option "Position Automatically" in the "Quick Help" window (available
  in the context menu of the text box): if activated, the window is positioned
  below the "Quick Help (?)" button whenever it is made visible (this used to be
  the default setting); otherwise, the window position will not be changed, and
  will be saved in the configuration .ini file

CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS:

- update check on start-up is executed in a separate thread (with low priority)
  rather than in the main thread to avoid latency times for the user
- new cube-shaped program icon, now also available in "extra large" size
  (256x256 pixels)
- activated "auto complete" feature in drop-down boxes in main window

FIXES:

- in the "Create Trigram File" dialog, clicking on the Browse button ("...")
  next to the source file box opened a "Save as" dialog rather than an "Open
  file" dialog
- fixed some issues concerning the "Always on Top" option
- "About" window was not sized correctly for higher DPI settings (>96 dpi)
- profiles deleted by the user were not removed from .ini file if settings were
  saved during runtime (before exit)
- fixed fatal error when user attempted to generate passwords with "Format
  password" checked but empty box

----------

Version 2.7.0 (2015-12-22)

NEW FEATURES:

- most windows in the program can now be changed in size, settings are stored
  in the configuration file and are reloaded on start-up
- for custom character sets ("Include words"), some placeholders may be
  either spelled in full or abbreviated, such as <base64> = <b64>, <easytoread>
  = <etr>, <symbols> = <sym>, etc. (see manual for more details)
- new option "Always on top" in the "Options" menu, which makes PWGen's main
  window and its subordinate windows the top-most windows on the screen
- "Provide additional entropy" functionality extended by "From file" option,
  which allows incorporating entire files into the random pool

CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS:

- "Quick help" windows have been redesigned: text can be selected and copied
  to the clipboard (Ctrl+C), user can scroll within the window using the
  mouse wheel
- "Quick help" button ("?") next to the "Format password" box is displayed
  constantly, even if the corresponding option is disabled
- "Multiple passwords" section more detached from other password options by
  separator line

FIXES:

- when PWGen was minimized to the system tray and the MP Password Generator was
  opened via the system tray popup menu and then closed, the window sometimes
  reappeared again when restoring the application, but could not be closed

----------

Version 2.6.0 (2015-09-02)

NEW FEATURES:

- new "Advanced" password options "Each character/word must occur only once";
  for formatted passwords, this option can be activated by specifying an
  asterisk (*) symbol between the "%" character and the format specifier;
  e.g., "%*16A" inserts 16 unique alphanumeric characters
- in formatted passwords, a number range in the form "x-y" can be specified to
  insert a random number between x and y of random characters from a character
  set; e.g., "%5-10L" inserts at least 5 and at most 10 random letters
- new "Provide Additional Entropy" window with a text box where you can enter
  or paste any text (preferably from volatile, non-static sources containing a
  certain amount of randomness), which is compressed to roughly estimate its
  entropy content and then added to the random pool
- beginning with this version, PWGen will display a checksum of the setup file
  (PWGen-xxx-setup.exe) in the update notification message box (i.e., when a
  new version is available)

CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS:

- "File Encoding" setting moved from "File" menu into "Configuration" dialog
  (sheet "Files") to make the program settings more consistent
- maximum number of profiles increased from 36 to 50 (note that the profiles
  from #37 onwards cannot be loaded via keyboard shortcuts)
- when the user tests passwords by entering text into the password box in the
  main window, the security bits value is marked with an asterisk (*) symbol
  (instead of a change in color)

FIXES:

- keyboard shortcuts changed from Ctrl+Shift+<X> (<X> = 0, ..., 9, A, ..., Z)
  to Ctrl+Alt+<X> (the first combination didn't work properly on Windows 7)
- allow storing negative window positions in case of multiple monitors (when
  certain windows were positioned outside the primary screen, they were
  re-positioned in the center of the primary screen upon restart)
- in formatted passwords, the security of permuted sequences (via "%N{...%}")
  was not calculated correctly if N was smaller than the original character
  sequence within the brackets
- opening the user manual from the "Help" menu sometimes caused the program to
  crash

----------

Version 2.5.4 (2015-03-12)

CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS:

- generation of unique password lists (i.e., lists where each entry must occur
  only once; activated by the option "Exclude duplicate entries" in the
  "Advanced Password Options") has been optimized for speed (at the expense
  of a roughly doubled memory requirement) and is much faster now even for very
  large password lists (>1 million entries)
- when generating password lists to files with the "Exclude duplicates" option
  activated, checking for duplicates is performed in-memory now instead of
  searching the entire file contents; as a consequence, the amount of passwords
  that can be generated in this case is limited by the memory available to a
  32-bit application like PWGen (... but it's also much faster now)
  (thanks to Hussein for reporting & valuable suggestions!); note that when the
  list is appended to an existing file, the file contents will NOT be searched
  anymore for already existing password entries, i.e., a new unique password
  list will be appended to the file

FIXES:

- generation of unique password lists didn't work properly for passphrases
  (composed of words from a word list)
- fixed a bug in the internal word list ("diceware8k" module), which reduced its
  effective size to 8191 instead of 8192 words (list contained an empty string
  due to the faulty encoding of a string in the C source code file); apart from
  (slightly!) reducing the entropy (12.9998 vs. 13), this empty word reduced the
  number of words in passphrases when randomly chosen and sometimes caused
  errors when converting passwords to UTF-8 Unicode encoding
- "out of memory" errors were not displayed correctly, a cryptic message was
  shown without the actual information

----------

Version 2.5.3 (2015-02-03)

NEW FEATURES:

- new character set "<phoneticx>" in addition to "<phonetic>" for generating
  phonetic passwords consisting of mixed-case letters, i.e., each letter will
  be either lower-case or upper-case (chosen randomly); this effectively
  increases the password security by 1.0 bit per character (thanks to Jimmy
  for the suggestion!)

CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS:

- when generating phonetic passwords with the options "Include at least one
  upper-case letter" and "Exclude ambiguous characters" activated, PWGen no
  longer checks which upper-case letters are not allowed and uses all 26 letters
  instead (reason: the "Exclude ..." option is not supposed to be effective
  for phonetic passwords)
- internal change: "Advanced password options" (which can be TRUE or FALSE)
  are stored as "bit masks" (integer values) instead of strings of 0s and 1s

----------

Version 2.5.2 (2014-11-13)

FIXES:

- random data files contained terminating non-random zeros (max. 15 bytes) if
  file size was not a multiple of 16 bytes (e.g., if file size was 100 bytes,
  the last 4 bytes (= 100 - 6*16) were zeros) (thanks to Glen for reporting!)

----------

Version 2.5.1 (2014-11-06)

CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS:

- PWGen can now be run in "installation" or "portable" mode, meaning that the
  configuration file (PWGen.ini) is stored either in the user-specific
  %APPDATA% folder or in the program folder (i.e., the folder where PWGen.exe
  is located); mode is controlled via the "UseAppDataPath" flag in the PWGen.ini
  file in the program folder, flag is set to 1 (TRUE, installation mode) during
  setup, but is 0 (FALSE, portable mode) by default
- further minor changes

FIXES:

- window "Create Random Data File" was not accessible, selecting the
  corresponding menu item opened the configuration window instead

----------

Version 2.5.0 (2014-10-09)

NEW FEATURES:

- new "Configuration" dialog allows changing the main configuration of the
  program within one window; dialog can be opened by clicking on the new "tools"
  button in the toolbar or via the main menu, i.e., Options / Configuration;
  several options which have previously been accessible via the "Options" menu
  have been moved to this window: GUI font selection, options concerning the
  system tray, and "hot key" settings
- new option "Clear clipboard automatically": if it is activated, the clipboard
  will be cleared automatically after a certain time (e.g., 10 seconds) whenever
  the user copies generated passwords to the clipboard
- new option "Automatic check for updates": enables automatic checks on start-up
  at regular intervals (i.e., daily, weekly, or monthly); you can also disable
  this option and manually check for updates (via Help / Check for Updates)
- new "Advanced" password option "Only include characters from custom character
  set": this option refers to the "Include at least one ..." (letter/digit/
  special symbol) options and means that if the latter options are activated,
  only characters (letters/digits/special symbols) from the user-defined
  (custom) character set will be included in the generated passwords; for
  example, if the custom set is "abcdEFGH" and the option "Include at least
  one lower-case letter" as well as the new option are activated, passwords
  will contain at least one lower-case letter from the set "abcd"
- new option "Encrypt & Copy" in the context menu of password boxes: encrypts
  the selected text and copies the ciphertext to the clipboard---no need to copy
  the plaintext to the clipboard first before calling the "Encrypt clipboard"
  function

CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS:

- button for "Create random data file" has been removed to make room for the
  new "tools" button (see above)
- the caption of the "Advanced" button in the main window is now marked with
  "(!)" when the user has selected options which could potentially reduce the
  security of passwords

FIXES:

- fatal error occurred when PWGen was started minimized and the icon in the
  system tray was right-clicked for the first time (thanks to Emil for
  reporting!)

----------

Version 2.4.0 (2013-12-14)

NEW FEATURES:

- new "password hasher" functionality, called "MP Password Generator"
  (MP = Master Password); accessible via the "Tools" item in the main menu
  or via the "magic hat" icon in the toolbar, the MPPG allows you to
  reproducibly generate unique passwords based on a secret master password and
  a parameter string, such as the name of the website account, etc.; it also
  provides a compatibility option for the online password hasher "Hashapass"
  (www.hashapass.com), intended for users who want to be independent of a
  Windows-based application
- the "deterministic" random generator from the MP Password Generator (see
  above) can be set as PWGen's default random generator, thus making password
  generation (and generation of random data files) in the main window fully
  reproducible; but see important notes in the manual!
- upon selecting certain functions (e.g., when clearing the clipboard) a small
  yellow info box is shown in the center of the main window to give the user
  a succinct feedback for the action

CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS:

- "exit" button in the toolbar has been removed to make room for the new
  "magic hat" button; quick exit can be accomplished by pressing Alt+Q

FIXES:

- fixed incorrect comparison between newer and older versions of PWGen

----------

Version 2.3.1 (2013-09-16)

FIXES:

- fixed a few bugs related to Unicode (some Unicode strings were erroneously
  converted to ANSI, resulting in strings containing "?" on systems with a
  codepage setting incompatible to the selected language)

----------

Version 2.3.0 (2013-09-08)

NEW FEATURES:

- full Unicode support throughout the entire application: passwords,
  translations, file names, word lists, text encryption, i.e., PWGen should be
  capable now of handling all theoretically possible 1,114,112 Unicode
  characters; yet PWGen should still run on Windows versions which are mostly
  ANSI-based (Windows 9x/Me)
- variable file encoding: PWGen is capable of reading and writing Unicode text
  files encoded as UTF-16 little-/big-endian, UTF-8 and (non-Unicode) ANSI
  (as identified by the byte-order mark at the beginning of the file); the
  desired encoding for writing Unicode text may be changed in the main menu
  via File / File Encoding
- generate phonetic (pronounceable) passwords: this feature has been residing
  on my infamous to-do list for a long, long time, but has now been realized,
  at last! phonetic passwords are based upon language-specific frequencies of
  trigrams (i.e., 3-letter combinations such as ing, riv, ...) (English by
  default) and can be activated by entering "<phonetic>" into the "Character
  set" field or using the format specifier %q in the "Format password" field;
  phonetic passwords generated with the default trigram table offer ~3.6 bits
  of entropy per letter
- create "trigram files" for generating phonetic passwords (via main menu:
  Tools > Create Trigram File): this is particularly useful for other languages
  which have Latin-derived alphabets; the user can specify any text file (e.g.,
  dictionary or word list), which is then analyzed by PWGen with respect to the
  frequencies of trigrams, and the resulting trigram table is written to a
  "trigram file", which can be loaded by PWGen in the "Advanced Password
  Options" dialog
- when generating password lists to a file, passwords may be appended to the
  file in case it already exists
- check for updates (main menu: Help > Check for Updates): PWGen checks via the
  Internet if a new version is available; if so, the user may be directed to the
  download page of the new version
- the font which is used to display most of the strings in the GUI can be
  changed via Options / Change Font

CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS:

- the format of text encryption has been changed again to provide Unicode
  support (for texts AND passwords), but PWGen is still capable of decrypting
  ciphertexts which were created with an older 2.x version

----------

Version 2.2.1 (2013-03-01)

FIXES:

- clicking on the main window (area around the border of group boxes)
  erroneously called a function that loaded a password generation profile,
  which caused an error if the profile list was empty
  (thanks to Cliff for reporting!)

----------

Version 2.2.0 (2013-02-27)

NEW FEATURES:

- password settings can be stored now as "profiles": to load, create or delete
  profiles, select File > Profile > ... in the main menu, or click F10 to show
  the profile editor
- new hot key options: PWGen can be associated with a "hot key" (special key
  combination), which allows for quickly generating passwords, for example
- new "advanced" password option "Reverse default order of character/word
  combinations" (see manual for more details)
- new "Generate" button (symbol next to the button for generating multiple
  passwords): enables writing the generated passwords directly to a file
  instead of displaying them in a window; process is independent of any
  RAM restrictions and practically only limited by free disk space

CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS:

- speed of password list generation increased significantly, particularly when
  duplicate entries are to be excluded
- memory usage for password list generation improved (i.e., lower memory
  requirements)
- max. number of passwords in password lists increased to 2,000,000,000
- max. size of password lists increased to 500,000,000 bytes
- max. number of words in word lists increased to 1,048,576 (corresponding to
  20 bits of entropy per word)
- "footnotes" in the "Advanced Password Options" dialog changed in order to
  clarify for which kinds of passwords (pass*words*, pass*phrases* or formatted
  passwords) each option refers to
- random pool uses HMAC-SHA-256 instead of plain SHA-256 now (HMAC has
  allegedly better randomness extraction properties)

FIXES:

- character set was not updated correctly in some cases

----------

Version 2.1.0 (2012-11-12)

NEW FEATURES:

- new option "Format Password": allows you to fully customize the passwords
  by providing a pattern-based generation using placeholders (for inserting
  characters from various character sets) and other format specifiers (e.g.,
  for permuting character sequences)
- introduction of command line switches
- ambiguous characters may be provided in groups of similar-looking characters
  (e.g., "B8 G6 I1l| 0OQD S5 Z2")
- new "Advanced" option "Convert all words in word lists to lower-case"
- word lists are loaded automatically
- new "quick help" buttons for character set & word list box
- new option "Enabled Password Testing" in context menu of password box:
  enables the user to manipulate the contents of the box and let PWGen
  estimate the security of the entered sequence
- new "password quality bar" below the password box: length & color of the bar
  signify security of the generated password (the longer & greener, the better)
- random seed file is created/overwritten in order to preserve entropy
  collected during runtime

CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS:

- function "Generate Password" in the context menu of the PWGen system tray
  icon can generate all kinds of passwords now (i.e., not limited to characters
  any more)
- text encryption scheme changed: HMAC of the plaintext (instead of the
  ciphertext) is generated, full 256 bits of HMAC-SHA-256 are used; an encrypted
  4-byte identification string serves to quickly check the key without having to
  compute the full HMAC; these changes allow for using other encryption
  algorithms besides AES in future versions
- backwards compatibility for old encryption scheme (PWGen <2.1.0) is provided
  in the password dialog by a checkbox
- random pool design changed (security increased)
- design of the random pool progress bar (and of other elements) changed
- version numbering changed: x.yz (old) -> x.y.z (new)

FIXES:

- minor fixes, but lots of internal changes in the code

----------

Version 2.08 (2012-03-17)
  - new "Create Random Data File" dialog: should be more convenient than the
    handling before
  - font of the generated password in the main window can be changed now
    ("Change Font" option accessible in the context menu of the box);
    problem was that the font "Fixedsys", which was used as fixed default
    before, could not display characters like the "Euro" symbol (€)
  - some obligatory bug fixes, code cleanup, ...

----------

Version 2.07 (2011-11-11)
  - improved handling of character sets: the user doesn't have to update the
    character set by clicking on a button any more; now the set is automatically
    updated as soon as possible without showing any message boxes
  - new "About" box design
  - some bug fixes etc.

----------

Version 2.06 (2011-02-10)
  - new option "Exclude duplicate entries in password lists" in the "Advanced
    Password Options" dialog: this option allows you to create unique lists
    in which each password entry occurs only once
  - maximum size of password lists has been extended to 1,000,000
  - generation of password lists runs much faster now
  - it is possible to cancel potentially time-consuming operations (generation
    of password lists and random data files) now, and their progress can be
    watched

----------

Version 2.05 (2010-09-23)
  - bugfix: using hotkeys (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, Del, etc.) in the "character set" and
    "word list file name" input boxes caused the program to crash (fatal error:
    access violation); thanks to bitarisu for reporting this bug
  - PWGen has a main menu now where the most important settings and tools can be
    accessed; the "Options" button was removed and replaced by an "Options" item
    in the main menu
  - toolbar buttons were provided with larger (and fancier) icons
  - option "maximum word length in word lists" moved to the "Advanced Password
    Options" dialog (value can be varied using the up/down buttons)
  - available languages are displayed with their version numbers now
    (e.g. "Deutsch (v2.05)")
  - some other minor changes and code cleanup

----------

Version 2.04 (2010-06-27)
  - new options "Redefine ambiguous characters" and "Redefine special symbols"
    in the "Advanced Password Options" dialog: these options allow the user
    to overwrite the default settings for the ambiguous characters and the
    character set of special symbols; the latter one is used for the pre-defined
    character set <symbols> and for the password option "Include at least one
    special symbol"
  - it is possible now to insert a comment at the beginning of the character
    set: the comment must be included in square brackets [comment] and will be
    ignored when the character set is loaded
  - the lists holding the character set and the word list file names,
    respectively, may contain up to 50 entries now; furthermore, it's possible
    to clear the lists via the popup menu (or by pressing Ctrl+Q)

----------

Version 2.03 (2009-11-04)
  - field for entering a word list file has been transformed into a list box
    that is capable of holding up to 16 entries (similar to the list box
    holding the character sets)
  - new option "Exclude repeating consecutive characters" in the "Advanced
    Password Options" dialog: this option ensures that every character in a
    password is different from the previous one (that is, sequences like "aa" or
    "11" in a password will be prevented)
  - minor changes in the program code

----------

Version 2.02 (2009-05-28)
  - new options in the "Advanced Password Options" dialog: the user can now
    force PWGen to include at least one upper-case/lower-case letter, digit
    or special symbol in the password
  - changed function "Generate and Show Password" (system tray menu):
    the message box has three buttons now (Yes, No and Cancel); "Yes" copies the
    password to the clipboard, "No" generates a new password, "Cancel" cancels
    the process
  - language version is now checked for compatibility
  - bugfix: if the word list size was not a power of 2, the generation algorithm
    sometimes delivered less words than specified (luckily, the default word 
    list and the lists included in the PWGen package all contain 8192 [= 2^13]
    words, so there was no problem when using one of these lists)

----------
  
Version 2.01 (2008-09-29)
  - new "Advanced Password Options" dialog accessible via the main window
    (button "Advanced"): in this dialog, the user can activate or deactivate
    various options regarding password generation; for example, it is possible
    now to generally exclude ambiguous characters (like B8I1O0...) from
    character sets
  - new pre-defined character sets <symbols> and <easytoread>; <symbols>
    defines special symbols accessible via the keyboard, whereas <easytoread>
    is equal to <AZ><az><09>, but without ambiguous characters
  - menu item "open documentation" has been replaced by a button in the
    main window
  - some minor changes and code cleanup...

----------

Version 2.00 (2008-04-24)
  - PWGen has been completely revised: new, more user-friendly and intuitive
    GUI, almost completely new program code
  - password generation follows a completely different design compared to
    PWGen 1.x
  - possibility to create large amounts of passwords (up to 32,767)
  - new random pool design: fast, lean and secure; SHA-256 is used to "distil"
    randomness from entropy data, AES functions as CSPRNG
  - maximum pool entropy reduced to 256 bits (more isn't really necessary!)
  - better entropy gathering: the program constantly collects entropy from
    keystrokes, mouse clicks and mouse movements (as well as entropy from
    system-specific parameters)
  - better text encryption: PWGen compresses the text now before encrypting it
    in CBC mode; key crunching is performed 8192 times to protect against
    dictionary attacks; this encryption scheme is NOT compatible to that
    used in PWGen 1.x!
  - new language interface: every language has its own file containing the
    English messages and their translations
  - more flexible handling of word lists: list size may range from minimum 2
    to maximum 65,536 words, and words may be separated by spaces, tabulators
    or line breaks (so in effect *any* kind of text file can be used, as long
    as it contains "words" not longer than 30 characters); furthermore, the
    maximum word length allowed in the list can be modified by the user
  - "Windows XP style" of the GUI
  - and much, much more!

----------

Please refer to the older versions of PWGen for the changes in PWGen 1.x!
