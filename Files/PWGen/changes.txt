Version 3.4.4

NEW FEATURES:

- PassCube password manager: Databases can be protected by key files in addition
  to or in place of a regular password; password entry dialog allows selection
  of key files and creation of new 256-bit key files
- PassCube: Recovery password (and/or key file) can be configured to enable
  recovery of the database in case the regular master password has been lost;
  databases can then be opened using either password; alternatively, the
  recovery password may function as an "administrator key" to allow individuals
  with elevated rights to access all databases in an organization (provided that
  all databases have been set up with the same recovery password)  
- PassCube: Remember last selected entry and tag(s) when locking database

CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS:

- PassCube: Changed HMAC algorithm (to protect data integrity and authenticity)
  from SHA-256 to SHA-512 in new version of database format (1.3)
- PassCube: Search options "Fuzzy" and "Case sensitive" moved to context menu,
  which can be accessed by right-clicking on the search button in the toolbar

  Properties..."
