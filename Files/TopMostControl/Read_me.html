			a certain window visible on your screen at all times, without losing 
			it behind your other applications , although Some Windows apps have 
			the built-in option to enable ‘always on top’ behavior, you can’t 
			get this option for every window unless it’s designed that way , As 
			soon as you click away to the desktop or another window, the current 
			one loses focus and moves to the background &quot;Windows Topmost 
			control&quot; is a portable freeware and extremely lightweight (315 kb) 
			application that can be used to make any application topmost , that 
			is to keep it above all other windows. This functionality is 
			identical to the &quot;Always on Top&quot; setting found in some programs , 
			with Windows Topmost control you can add this feature to any 
			program.</font><b><p><font face="Arial"><font color="#0000FF">How to use:</font> </font></b>
			<font face="Arial">The application doesn’t have a GUI , Once it's 
			running and you see the icon in your system tray, just 
			<font color="#0000FF">double click</font> 
			on it or use <font color="#0000FF">Ctrl + Alt + Space</font> to lock your currently-selected 
			window to the top level of your screen . Now, even if you focus on 
			another window, this application will always stay on top. </font>
			</p>
			<p><font face="Arial">To unlock it , just select it again and use 
			the same shortcut or you can right click it's taskbar icon and 
			untick the program name under the windows .</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial">It's as simple as it gets, but sometimes 
			that's all you need , It can prove to be useful if you want to keep 
			a certain folder or application – such as a media player, document 
			editor, photo viewer, etc.</font></p>
